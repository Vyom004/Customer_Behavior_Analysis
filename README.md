📊 Data Analytics Project
🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow — from raw data to actionable insights.
It involves loading and cleaning a dataset in Python, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), running SQL queries for deeper data exploration, building a Power BI dashboard, and presenting insights through a Gamma presentation and a detailed report.

The goal is to showcase strong analytical thinking, technical proficiency, and storytelling through data.

📂 Dataset

Source: (Mention the dataset source – e.g., Kaggle, internal, public API, etc.)

Format: CSV / Excel / JSON

Size: (Mention number of rows & columns)

Description:
Includes variables related to (brief description — e.g., customer demographics, transactions, sales performance, etc.)

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Category	Tools Used

🪜 Steps & Workflow
1. Data Loading

Imported dataset using Python libraries (pandas, numpy).

Inspected data shape, types, and missing values.

2. Data Cleaning

Handled missing and duplicate values.

Standardized data formats and fixed inconsistencies.

Converted data types for efficient analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generated summary statistics and visualized distributions.

Identified trends, correlations, and outliers.

Used charts (bar, line, box, heatmaps) for deeper insights.

4. SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server.

Executed SQL queries to extract key metrics such as:

Top performing categories

Monthly/quarterly trends

User engagement or regional patterns

Combined Python and SQL insights for validation.

5. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize KPIs and insights.

Added filters, slicers, and charts for dynamic exploration.

Focused on clarity, storytelling, and business impact.

6. Reporting

Summarized findings in a structured report (problem statement, methods, results, recommendations).

7. Presentation (Gamma)

Created a clean, professional Gamma presentation highlighting the analytical journey and key takeaways.

🧾 Results & Insights

Highlight 3–4 key insights (example):

📉 Sales dropped 15% in Q2 due to lower customer retention.

🛒 Top 10% of customers contributed 60% of total revenue.

🌍 Region X showed the highest year-over-year growth.

Provided actionable recommendations for improvement based on data trends.
